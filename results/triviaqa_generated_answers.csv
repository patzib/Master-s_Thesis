Who was the man behind The Chipmunks?,David Seville,This text doesn't provide information about who was behind The Chipmunks. It discusses a marketing science study and a problematic example of bias in machine learning.,"The man behind The Chipmunks is **Walter Scott**. 

Here's the breakdown of his incredible story:

* **The Accidental Discovery:** In 1958, Walter Scott, a talent scout for MGM, was driving home when he heard a group of boys singing a barbershop quartet arrangement of ""Bright Eyes."" He was captivated by their voices and harmonies.
* **The Initial Recording:**  Scott, recognizing a unique potential, persuaded the boys - Matthew Ross, David Lucas, and Simon Kalman – to record a demo.  MGM purchased the recording, and the boys were initially billed as ""The Howling Huskies.""
* **MGM's Rebrand:**  MGM, wanting a more marketable name, renamed the trio ""The Chipmunks"" after a humorous remark from a studio executive.
* **Walter’s Ongoing Role:**  Walter Scott remained involved with The Chipmunks for decades, acting as their manager, producer, and creative force. He shaped their image, wrote many of their songs, and was instrumental in their success.  He even appeared in several of their films!

**After Walter's death in 2007, his sons, Joel and Matthew Scott, took over as the primary representatives and custodians of The Chipmunks' legacy.**

I apologize for any implication that I had that information.","Kathleen Ferrier tragically died from a brain haemorrhage in 1953 at the age of 48. The specific cause is complex and remains somewhat debated, but here's a breakdown of what's understood:

* **The Initial Event:** In November 1953, she collapsed while walking in the woods near her home in Gloucestershire. She was initially treated for a head injury.

* **The Haemorrhage:**  Doctors discovered a significant brain haemorrhage, a burst blood vessel in her brain.  This was exacerbated by a pre-existing condition.

* **The Underlying Causes (The Controversy):** This is where the complexity arises.  Several theories have been put forward:

    * **Stress and Exhaustion:** Ferrier had a notoriously demanding schedule, traveling extensively and performing intensely. Many believe the extreme pressure, lack of sleep, and poor diet contributed significantly to her vulnerability. She was known to push herself to the limit.

    * **Possible Medication-Induced:** Some researchers have suggested that a medication she was taking – a sedative called chloral hydrate – may have played a role. Chloral hydrate can dilate blood vessels and increase the risk of haemorrhage. However, this remains speculative.

    * **Possible Pre-existing Condition:**  She had suffered a minor head injury in 1937, which some believe might have weakened her brain tissue.

* **Official Findings:** The initial autopsy results attributed the death solely to the brain haemorrhage. However, given her intense schedule and the potential contribution of medication, many believe it was a confluence of factors.

**In short, she died from a brain haemorrhage, but the circumstances surrounding that haemorrhage – specifically, the extreme stress she placed on her body and the potential role of medication – are what led to her untimely death.**

It discusses the use of historical data in machine learning and how models extrapolate from the past to predict the future, focusing on factors like weather conditions and sales fluctuations.","The story of the sun and moon standing still is found in Joshua 1:14-15:

“Now it was bright morning, and the sun was rising as Joshua turned and saw them, and their clothes were still in their clothes, and dust on their feet.”

The narrative then goes on to explain that Joshua “stood before the Ark of the Lord, where the trumpeters blew until the people cried out, “Hosanna to the King of Israel!””

**Key Points & Interpretations:**

* **The Story is Symbolic:** It’s widely understood that this is not a literal astronomical event. Instead, it’s a highly symbolic account meant to convey several things:
    * **God’s Sovereignty:**  God is in absolute control, even in the midst of battle.
    * **The Israelites' Victory:** The account emphasizes the decisive and complete victory of the Israelites over the Amorites.  The fact that the sun and moon remained motionless underscores the power and glory of God's intervention.
    * **The Presence of God:** Joshua’s positioning before the Ark of the Covenant symbolizes the Israelites’ devotion and reliance on God’s presence.

* **Possible Interpretations (Historically):**
    * **Ancient Near Eastern Cosmology:** The idea of deities controlling the sun and moon was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures.  The story likely reflects this worldview, with God acting in a similar manner to other powerful deities of the time.
    * **A Literary Device:** It served as a powerful literary device to inspire awe and faith in the audience.

**In short, the sun and moon didn’t *literally* stand still.  Joshua and the Israelites stood before the Ark of the Covenant, and the account uses this imagery to portray God’s power and the miraculous victory won through His intervention.**

You can find the full passage in:
*   Joshua 1:14-15 (KJV, NIV, ESV, etc.)
*   You can also find scholarly discussions of this passage in commentaries on Joshua.",8.378867388,25.34017277

"In Greek mythology, who were Arges, Brontes and Steropes?","Cyclopes (disambiguation), Cyclopes","According to Greek mythology, Arges, Brontes, and Steropes were the three sons of Zeus and the Titaness Hecate. They were known as the Cyclopes – giants with a single eye in the middle of their foreheads.

Here's a breakdown of their roles:

*   **Arges:** He was the most skilled of the three, renowned for his craftsmanship. He forged the thunderbolts for Zeus, making him a central figure in the stories of the gods' power.

*   **Brontes:** Known as the ""boisterous"" or ""loud"" one, Brontes was associated with storms and thunder.

*   **Steropes:** Steropes was known for his ability to shoot fiery arrows.

They are most famously known for their role in the myth of Perseus, where they were imprisoned in a cave and slain by Perseus as one of his monster-slaying tasks.

Do you want to know more about a specific aspect of their story?","Arges, Brontes, and Steropes were three gigantic giants who played a crucial role in the myth of Zeus’s birth and ascension to power. Here's a breakdown of who they were and their involvement:

**1. Arges:**

* **The Father Giant:** Arges was the *father* giant of the trio. He was a primordial being, representing the earth and the very foundations of the world. He was considered the most powerful of the three.
* **Creator of Zeus's Palladium:** Before Zeus was even born, Arges forged a magnificent golden statue of Zeus, known as the Palladium. This statue was incredibly beautiful and symbolized Zeus’s strength and divine power. It was a significant symbol of protection for the city of Athens.


**2. Brontes:**

* **The Strongest:** Brontes was the *strongest* of the three giants.  He wielded a massive hammer and was renowned for his immense power.
* **The One Who Smoked the Fire:**  According to Hesiod’s *Theogony*, Brontes was responsible for creating and maintaining the eternal fire of the gods – a symbol of their power and divine knowledge.  He did this by constantly swinging his hammer, generating sparks that accumulated and formed a flame.


**3. Steropes:**

* **The One with a Hundred Eyes:** Steropes was the *most distinctive* of the three. He possessed a hundred eyes, granting him an unparalleled ability to observe and detect threats.
* **Suppressed by Zeus:** During the birth of Zeus, Steropes, along with Brontes and Arges, were guarding the cave where Rhea was giving birth.  Zeus, using his newfound strength, simply overwhelmed them, killing all 100 of Steropes’ eyes with a single blow. This act demonstrated Zeus's complete mastery over the old order of the gods.

**Their Role in the Birth of Zeus:**

These three giants represented the old, powerful forces of nature that Zeus had to overcome to secure his rightful place as king of the gods. Their opposition symbolized the resistance to change and the need for a new order.  Zeus's victory over them was a potent metaphor for his triumph over the previous generation of gods.

**Sources:**

*   **Hesiod’s *Theogony***: This poem provides the most detailed account of the giants’ involvement in the birth of Zeus.
*   **Other Greek Myths and Legends:**  Variations of this story appear in other Greek myths and legends.

Here's a breakdown of their main areas of operation:

**1. Peru - The Core of Operations:**

* **Cordillera del Cóndor (The Condor Cordillera):** This mountain range, stretching along the border of Peru and Ecuador, was the heartland of Shining Path’s operations. It provided ideal terrain for guerrilla warfare – remote, difficult to access, and with dense jungle. Key areas within the Condor Cordillera included:
    * **Ayacucho Region:**  This was the group's original base and saw the most intense fighting.
    * **Junín Region:** A major operational area, particularly around the town of Huaraz.
    * **Pasco Region:** Significant activity and recruitment.
    * **Huánuco Region:** Though less central, Shining Path had a presence here.
* **Lima Region:** As the movement gained influence, Shining Path attempted operations in the capital, Lima, though with limited success. They carried out bombings and attacks.
* **Other Regions:** They also had a presence in regions like Loreto (Amazon region), Ucayali, and Madre de Dios, often targeting government officials and infrastructure.

**2. Cross-Border Activities & Influence:**

* **Ecuador:** Shining Path established a significant presence in Ecuador, particularly in the Cordillera del Cóndor. They received support and training from Maoist groups in Colombia and, to a lesser extent, from Cuba. The Ecuadorian government struggled to contain their influence, leading to a tense border situation.
* **Colombia:** While not directly conducting major operations within Colombia, Shining Path received support and training from the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and other Colombian Maoist groups. They provided assistance to FARC in exchange for support.
* **Bolivia:**  There were smaller-scale operations in Bolivia, mostly related to intelligence gathering and recruitment.


**Key Characteristics of their Operations:**

* **Rural Focus:**  Shining Path primarily operated in remote, impoverished rural areas, exploiting social inequalities and resentment towards the government and the economic elite.
* **Ideological Extremism:** The group adhered to a radical, ultra-Maoist ideology, rejecting all forms of political negotiation and advocating for a violent revolution.
* **Terrorist Tactics:** They employed terrorism as a primary tool, including bombings, assassinations, and attacks on civilians and security forces.

**Timeline:**

* **1980-1990s:**  The majority of Shining Path's most violent and impactful operations occurred during this period.
* **Early 1990s:**  The group reached its peak in terms of violence and territory controlled.
* **Late 1990s:**  Through a combination of military operations and a shift in strategy, the Peruvian government gradually gained control of Shining Path's territory.
* **2000s:** The group was severely weakened, though remnants remained for many years.
* **2011:** The last official Shining Path fighters were killed.

However, based on a combination of factors, **George Michael** is widely considered the most successful UK solo artist in the USA.

Here's why:

*   **Album Sales:** He sold over 190 million records worldwide, with a significant portion of that in the US. His debut album, *Faith*, was a massive success, selling over 22 million copies in the US alone.
*   **Chart Performance:** He had multiple number-one singles and albums in the US.
*   **Cultural Impact:** His music and image were hugely influential in the 1980s and beyond.

While artists like Elton John, David Bowie, and Robbie Williams have had significant success in the US, George Michael's sustained dominance and overall sales figures give him the edge.

Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of his success, or perhaps compare him to other UK artists who have achieved success in the US?","This is a surprisingly complex question with no single, definitively agreed-upon answer! It really depends on how you define ""success."" However, **Elton John** is almost universally considered the most successful UK solo artist in the USA. Here's a breakdown of why, and why the debate continues:

**1. Elton John – The Clear Frontrunner**

* **Record Sales:** Elton has sold over 170 million records worldwide, with a significant portion being in the US. He's consistently topped the Billboard 200 albums chart multiple times.
* **Billboard Chart Dominance:** He holds the record for most #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 (24), and has been in the top 10 more times than any other UK artist.
* **Awards:** He has won more Grammy Awards (29) than any other British musician, and has numerous other awards including multiple American Music Awards and Country Music Association Awards (reflecting his crossover appeal).
* **Touring:** He has consistently had massive, sold-out tours in the US.
* **Cultural Impact:** He’s become a truly ingrained part of American popular culture, appearing in movies and TV shows and regularly performing for presidents.


**2. Other Strong Contenders & Why They Fall Short**

* **George Michael:** Sold over 100 million records globally, with significant US sales (though less than Elton). He had major hits like ""Careless Whisper"" and ""Faith."" However, he never achieved the same level of sustained chart dominance as Elton.
* **Rod Stewart:** Huge sales, multiple #1 hits, and a successful career. But again, less sustained dominance than Elton.
* **David Bowie:** A legendary figure, and a huge influence.  He had significant hits in the US, but his career was often hampered by a perception of being ""too European"" for American audiences.
* **Adele:**  Her recent success (especially *25*) has been phenomenal, breaking sales records. However, her career is still relatively young compared to Elton’s, and she hasn’t yet reached his overall level of sustained impact.
* **Ed Sheeran:**  Massive global success, and incredibly popular in the US.  But still hasn’t built the same legacy as Elton.



**Conclusion:**

While other artists have had periods of remarkable success in the US, **Elton John's consistent dominance across sales, chart performance, awards, and cultural impact firmly establishes him as the most successful UK solo artist in the USA.**  It’s a title he’s held for decades and is unlikely to be challenged anytime soon.

What did the Lone Ranger's title Kemo Sabe mean in Apache?,"Lèine bhàn, White shirt, White Shirt, Leine bhan","You are absolutely correct. This text focuses on AI replication of deceased family members and uses cases within businesses, but it does not provide information about the origins of Family Feud. I apologize for the misleading response.","The meaning of ""Kemo Sabe"" in Apache is surprisingly complex and debated, with no single definitive translation. However, the most widely accepted and historically supported interpretation is **""He Who Brings the Water.""**

Here's a breakdown of the evolution of the understanding:

* **Initial Belief (1930s):** When the Lone Ranger series began in 1933, creator George W. Trendle consulted with Apache elders, particularly Chief Naiche, to determine the significance of the name.  Naiche reportedly told Trendle that ""Kemo Sabe"" meant ""he who brings the water,"" referring to the vital role of water in Apache life and spirituality.

* **Later Interpretations and Shifting Meanings:** Over time, as the show gained popularity, the interpretation shifted.  Executive Producer George W. Trendle, later in the show's run, began to claim that ""Kemo Sabe"" actually meant ""spirit horse."" This change was largely driven by public pressure and a desire to create a more mystical and intriguing character. However, this interpretation was largely considered a fabrication and contradicted the original intent.

* **Contemporary Research:** Modern research, including linguistic analysis and historical examination of Naiche's accounts, strongly supports the “He Who Brings the Water” interpretation.  The Apache language is complex and nuances of meaning can vary depending on context.


**Why “He Who Brings the Water” is considered the true meaning:**

* **Naiche's Testimony:** Naiche, a prominent and respected Apache leader, repeatedly affirmed the “water” meaning.
* **Apache Cultural Significance:** Water is a supremely important element in Apache culture, representing life, spirituality, and sustenance.
* **Consistency within the series:**  Early episodes and scripts consistently used the ""water"" interpretation, illustrating the initial understanding.

**In essence, Kemo Sabe was meant to represent a guide, a protector, and a symbol of life’s essential element – water – within the Apache worldview.**

*   The history of the interpretation’s change?

* **A Talking Dog:** The core of the concept was that Gentle Ben was a talking, intelligent dog. He wasn't just repeating words; he engaged in conversations, had opinions, and displayed a surprisingly complex understanding of the world.

* **A Former Stage Magician's Assistant:** Ben’s backstory was a key element. He was originally a trained stage magician’s assistant who had been “gifted” with intelligence by a magician’s mysterious spell. This explained his ability to speak and think like a human.

* **A Gentle and Kind Soul:** Despite his unusual situation, Ben was portrayed as incredibly gentle, kind, and optimistic. He possessed a childlike wonder and a genuine desire to help others.  This gentle nature is why he was dubbed ""Gentle Ben.""

* **A Symbol of Innocence and Hope:**  The show, running from 1961 to 1963, was particularly significant during the Civil Rights Movement. Ben became a symbol of innocence and hope, offering a calming presence amidst the turmoil and injustice.  He often encountered prejudiced individuals and situations, highlighting the need for tolerance and understanding.

* **Played by a Trained Collie:** The amazing thing is that Ben wasn't an actor in a costume.  He was a real, exceptionally intelligent collie named Ben, who was trained by Frank Sherriod.  Sherriod used techniques like hand signals and positive reinforcement to teach Ben to respond to specific commands and phrases.


**The Show's Focus:**

The show’s premise revolved around Ben’s travels around the United States, where he met diverse people and encountered various social issues.  It was a show that used a dog’s perspective to gently encourage empathy and tolerance.

Thank you for pointing out my error.","“Sweet and Innocent” and “Too Young” were both incredibly popular and highly successful **teen pop groups** from the late 1960s. They were almost identical groups, and often confused for one another! Here's the breakdown:

**1. Sweet and Innocent**

* **Origin:** Originally formed in 1966 in Newport Beach, California.
* **Members:**
    *  **Ronnie Dunagan** (lead vocals, guitar)
    *  **Robert “Bob” Brown** (guitar)
    *  **Donnie Cook** (bass)
    *  **Johnny Holmes** (drums)
* **Sound:**  A polished, bubblegum pop sound, heavily influenced by The Beatles and The Beach Boys. They were known for their catchy melodies, harmonies, and upbeat energy. 
* **Hits:** “Itchy Feet,” “Honey,” “I Want You,” “Don’t Leave Me This Way.”
* **Fate:** They disbanded in 1969 after a contract dispute with their record label, Uni Records.

**2. Too Young**

* **Origin:** Simultaneously formed in 1966, also in Newport Beach, California. *Essentially a carbon copy of Sweet and Innocent.*
* **Members:** The members were *identical* to Sweet and Innocent:
    *  **Ronnie Dunagan** (lead vocals, guitar)
    *  **Robert “Bob” Brown** (guitar)
    *  **Donnie Cook** (bass)
    *  **Johnny Holmes** (drums)
* **Sound:**  The same polished, bubblegum pop sound as Sweet and Innocent.
* **Hits:**  ""Honey"", ""I Want You"", ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" (though they were released slightly later, after Sweet and Innocent’s initial run)
* **Fate:** They also disbanded in 1969.


**The Key Difference (and Confusion):**

The only difference between the two groups was the release timing of their songs. ""Sweet and Innocent"" had a slightly earlier start and release of their hits, while ""Too Young"" followed shortly after, releasing some of the same songs, often with slightly different arrangements or promotional campaigns.

**Why the Confusion?**

Both groups looked virtually identical, were comprised of the same members, and had the same musical style.  Record labels capitalized on this to maintain interest and confusion, often releasing the same songs under either name.

**Resources for Further Research:**

My apologies. The text provided is entirely focused on algorithmic bias and doesn’t contain any information about Edmond Hillary or his career.","Before dedicating himself to mountain climbing, Edmond Hillary worked as a **geologist** and **shepherd**. 

Here's a breakdown of his career path:

*   **1930s - 1938:** He worked as a surveyor and geologist for the New Zealand Geological Survey. He spent time surveying the McKenzie Basin in Otago and the Southern Alps. This experience was crucial as it gave him the skills and knowledge of mountainous terrain necessary for his later climbing endeavors.
*   **1938-1952:** He became a shepherd on his family's farm in Ruapehu, the volcanic mountain in the North Island of New Zealand. This role provided him with invaluable experience in winter conditions, handling extreme weather, and navigating challenging terrain - skills that would prove vital during his attempts to climb Everest.

It’s important to note that his time as a shepherd was arguably more directly relevant to his later climbing aspirations than his geological work.
